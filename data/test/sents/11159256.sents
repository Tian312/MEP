The pain intensity was rated on a numeric analog scale .
In 38 patients who completed Phase 1 , significant delay in pain increase was observed in the CMZ group as compared with placebo ( P = 0.038 ) .
In Phase 2 , the trend observed with morphine was insignificant ( P = 0.41 ) .
We conclude that CMZ is effective in peripheral neuropathic pain .
Morphine obviously requires larger individually titrated dosages than those used in this study for results to be adequately interpreted .

{"doc_id": "10097996", "abstract": "The TOM test : a new instrument for assessing theory of mind in normal children and children with pervasive developmental disorders . This article describes a first attempt to investigate the reliability and validity of the TOM test , a new instrument for assessing theory of mind ability in normal children and children with pervasive developmental disorders ( PDDs ) . In Study 1 , TOM test scores of normal children ( n = 70 ) correlated positively with their performance on other theory of mind tasks . Furthermore , young children only succeeded on TOM items that tap the basic domains of theory of mind ( e.g. , emotion recognition ) , whereas older children also passed items that measure the more mature areas of theory of mind ( e.g. , understanding of humor , understanding of second-order beliefs ) . Taken together , the findings of Study 1 suggest that the TOM test is a valid measure . Study 2 showed for a separate sample of normal children ( n = 12 ) that the TOM test possesses sufficient test-retest stability . Study 3 demonstrated for a sample of children with PDDs ( n = 10 ) that the interrater reliability of the TOM test is good . Study 4 found that children with PDDs ( n = 20 ) had significantly lower TOM test scores than children with other psychiatric disorders ( e.g. , children with Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ; n = 32 ) , a finding that underlines the discriminant validity of the TOM test . Furthermore , Study 4 showed that intelligence as indexed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was positively associated with TOM test scores . Finally , in all studies , the TOM test was found to be reliable in terms of internal consistency . Altogether , results indicate that the TOM test is a reliable and valid instrument that can be employed to measure various aspects of theory of mind .", "Evidence Map": {"study design":

{"doc_id": "8966003", "abstract": "[ Drug therapy of condylomata acuminata ] . This study seeks to evaluate two candidate regimens ( 5-fluorouracil and interferon ) as adjuvants to optimally performed laser surgery in the treatment of condylomata acuminata . Skillful laser ablation can remove any volume of human papillomavirus-associated vulvar disease but can not prevent reactivation of the surrounding latent viral reservoir during postoperative healing . Conversely , interferon and 5-fluorouracil are relatively ineffective as primary therapies . This study involves 118 evaluable patients : 32 in the laser-CO2 group , 34 in the 5-fluorouracil group and 52 in the interferon group . At assessment of final outcome , it was found that 43 of 52 ( 82 % ) assessable patients in the adjuvant interferon arm were controlled by a single laser ablation as compared with only 17 of 34 ( 50 % ) in the 5-fluorouracil group and 13 of 32 ( 40 % ) in the laser alone group . There was no statistical difference in outcome within the 5-fluorouracil and laser only arms . Conversely , a relatively low dose of recombinant interferon , used in combination with effective surgical deleulking , can markedly reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence .", "study design":

{"doc_id": "11196396", "abstract": "Comparison of the efficacy of fluoxetine alone vs. fluoxetine plus local lidocaine ointment in the treatment of premature ejaculation . OBJECTIVE The present study compares the efficacy and side effects of fluoxetine alone vs. fluoxetine plus local lidocaine ointment in the treatment of premature ejaculation . METHODS Forty-three patients suffering from premature ejaculation were studied . The exclusion criteria were erectile dysfunction , loss of libido , alcohol and substance abuse , mental retardation , diabetes mellitus , thyroid disease , hypotension , previous use of these drugs and urogenital infections . The patients ' ages ranged from 19 to 48 years ( mean age 28 +/- 1.6 ) . They had regular sexual lives . They had normal psychiatric consultation and the Glombock Rast Sexual Satisfactory Test ( GRISS ) psychiatric test were in accordance with premature ejaculation . RESULTS The patients were assigned to two groups . Twenty-six patients , aged 21 to 36 years ( mean age 27 ) , received only fluoxetine 20 mg/day ( 1 capsule ) for a week which was later increased to 40 mg/day ( 2 capsules ) . Seventeen patients , aged 19 to 48 years ( mean age 31 ) , were given fluoxetine 20 mg/day plus local application of lidocaine ointment . The patients and partners were re-evaluated 8 weeks after the treatment . The results were classified as unsuccessful , improvement and cure . The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis . In the fluoxetine group , 8 ( 30.8 % ) patients cured , 11 ( 42.2 % ) showed improvement and there were 7 failures ( 26.9 % ) . In the combination treatment group , 9 ( 52.9 % ) patients cured , improvement was observed in 5 ( 29.4 % ) and failure in 3 ( 17.6 % ) . Side effects in group I were observed in 6 patients ( 23 % ) and in 5 ( 29.4 % ) in group II . There were no statistical differences between the two groups according to the side effects ( p > 0.01 ) . No patients were excluded from the study due to side effects . CONCLUSION The combination of fluoxetine plus local application of lidocaine ointment was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone in the treatment of premature ejaculation . However , the results should be confirmed in further studies with a placebo group to rule out the placebo effect .", "study design": {"Participant": "", "Intervention": "", "Outcome": "",

18390985 | Dual-chamber defibrillators reduce clinically significant adverse events compared with single-chamber devices: results from the DATAS (Dual chamber and Atrial Tachyarrhythmias Adverse events Study) trial. | AIMS: This randomized trial evaluated clinically significant adverse events (CSAEs), in patients implanted with dual-chamber (DC) vs. single-chamber (SC) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). DC-ICD had atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) therapy capabilities. Strict programming recommendations were reinforced. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with conventional SC-ICD indication were randomized to DC-ICD, SC-ICD, or a DC-ICD programmed as an SC-ICD (SC-simulated) and followed for 16 months. Patients in the DC and SC-simulated groups crossed over after 8 months. The primary endpoint was a composite of CSAE: all-cause mortality; invasive intervention; hospitalization (> 24 h) for cardiovascular causes; inappropriate shocks (two or more episodes); and sustained symptomatic AT lasting > 48 h. The outcome variable was a pre-specified score that corrected for clinical severity and follow-up duration. Three hundred and thirty-four patients were analysed (DC-ICD, n = 112; SC-ICD, n = 111; SC-simulated, n = 111). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.36 +/- 0.13, 69% were in functional class > or = II. CSAE occurred in 65 DC-ICD, 82 SC-ICD, and 84 SC-simulated patients. The outcome variable was 33% lower in the DC-ICD group (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.14-0.67; P = 0.0028). Mortality was 4% in DC, 9% in SC, and 10% in SC-simulated. CONCLUSION: In patients with a standard SC-ICD indication, DC-ICD was associated with less CSAE when compared with SC-ICD.
10228190 | Infliximab for the treatment of fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease. | BACKGROUND: Enterocutaneous fistulas are a serious complication of Crohn's disease and are difficult to treat. Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to tumor necrosis factor alpha, has recently been developed as a treatment for Crohn's disease. We conducted a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of infliximab for the treatment of fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: The study included 94 adult patients who had draining abdominal or perianal fistulas of at least three months' duration as a complication of Crohn's disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: placebo (31 patients), 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram of body weight (31 patients), or 10 mg of infliximab per kilogram (32 patients); all three were to be administered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary end point was a reduction of 50 percent or more from base line in the number of draining fistulas observed at two or more consecutive study visits. A secondary end point was the closure of all fistulas. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of the patients who received 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram and 56 percent of those who received 10 mg per kilogram achieved the primary end point, as compared with 26 percent of the patients in the placebo group (P=0.002 and P=0.02, respectively). In addition, 55 percent of the patients assigned to receive 5 mg of infliximab per kilogram and 38 percent of those assigned to 10 mg per kilogram had closure of all fistulas, as compared with 13 percent of the patients assigned to placebo (P=0.001 and P=0.04, respectively). The median length of time during which the fistulas remained closed was three months. More than 60 percent of patients in all the groups had adverse events. For patients treated with infliximab, the most common were headache, abscess, upper respiratory tract infection, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab is an efficacious treatment for fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease.
10392863 | Comparative analysis of early and late angiographic outcomes using two quantitative algorithms in the Balloon versus Optimal Atherectomy Trial (BOAT). | Although substantial intersystem variability has been shown among several commercially available quantitative angiographic (QA) analysis algorithms, no previous study has compared the angiographic findings using 2 different QA systems performed at the same central angiographic laboratory. The purpose of this study was to compare the early and late QA results obtained with the CMS (MEDIS) and ARTREK (ImageComm) QA systems in the Balloon versus Optimal Atherectomy Trial. Directional atherectomy (n = 496) or balloon angioplasty (n = 490) was performed in 986 patients; late QA follow-up was available in 767 patients (77.7%). QA analysis was performed by 2 independent observers using the CMS and ARTREK systems. Correlation between the 2 QA systems for baseline measurements was good (Pearson's R = 0.78), although the CMS system resulted in larger baseline reference diameter (RD) (3.22 +/- 0.45 vs 3.07 +/- 0.40 mm; p <0.0001) and baseline minimal lumen diameters (MLD) (1.05 +/- 0.35 vs 0.92 +/- 0.32; mm p <0.0001) than the ARTREK system. The final and follow-up RD (+0.17 and +0.11 mm, respectively) were also larger using the CMS system. In contrast, the final and follow-up measurements of MLD and percent diameter stenosis were not significantly different using the 2 QA systems. The QA system did not affect the ability to detect a difference in restenosis rates (>50% follow-up diameter stenosis) between the 2 treatment groups (CMS, directional atherectomy [31.8%]; balloon angioplasty [40.5%]; p = 0.013 and ARTREK, directional atherectomy [33.9%], balloon angioplasty [41.3%]; p = 0.036). Only lesion irregularity contributed to the difference in baseline measurements of MLD and percent diameter stenosis. We conclude that important differences in measurements of RD, baseline MLD, and percent diameter stenosis were noted using the CMS and ARTREK systems. Both systems, however, were able to detect a treatment benefit associated with directional atherectomy in BOAT. The comparability of other angiographic systems will require similar evaluation in other studies.
10400005 | Sustained hemodynamic effects of an infusion of nesiritide (human b-type natriuretic peptide) in heart failure: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Natrecor Study Group. | OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to further define the role of nesiritide (human b-type natriuretic peptide) in the therapy of decompensated heart failure (HF) by assessing the hemodynamic effects of three doses (0.015, 0.03 and 0.06 microg/kg/min) administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 24 h as compared with placebo. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown beneficial hemodynamic, neurohormonal and renal effects of bolus dose and 6-h infusion administration of nesiritide in HF patients. Longer term safety and efficacy have not been studied. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial enrolled subjects with symptomatic HF and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%). Central hemodynamics were assessed at baseline, during a 24-h IV infusion and for 4 h postinfusion. RESULTS: One hundred three subjects with New York Heart Association class II (6%), III (61%) or IV (33%) HF were enrolled. Nesiritide produced significant reductions in pulmonary wedge pressure (27% to 39% decrease by 6 h), mean right atrial pressure and systemic vascular resistance, along with significant increases in cardiac index and stroke volume index, with no significant effect on heart rate. Beneficial effects were evident at 1 h and were sustained throughout the 24-h infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and sustained beneficial hemodynamic effects of nesiritide observed in this study support its use as a first-line IV therapy for patients with symptomatic decompensated HF.
10403850 | Neostigmine for the treatment of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. | BACKGROUND: Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction -- that is, massive dilation of the colon without mechanical obstruction -- may develop after surgery or severe illness. Although it may resolve with conservative therapy, colonoscopic decompression is sometimes needed to prevent ischemia and perforation of the bowel. Uncontrolled studies have suggested that neostigmine, may be an effective treatment. METHODS: We studied 21 patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. All had abdominal distention and radiographic evidence of colonic dilation, with a cecal diameter of at least 10 cm, and had had no response to at least 24 hours of conservative treatment. We randomly assigned 11 to receive 2.0 mg of neostigmine intravenously and 10 to receive intravenous saline. A physician who was unaware of the patients' treatment assignments recorded clinical response (defined as prompt evacuation of flatus or stool and a reduction in abdominal distention), abdominal circumference, and measurements of the colon on radiographs. Patients who had no response to the initial injection were eligible to receive open-label neostigmine three hours later. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 patients who received neostigmine had prompt colonic decompression, as compared with none of the 10 patients who received placebo (P<0.001). The median time to response was 4 minutes (range, 3 to 30). Seven patients in the placebo group and the one patient in the neostigmine group without an initial response received open-label neostigmine; all had colonic decompression. Two patients who had an initial response to neostigmine required colonoscopic decompression for recurrence of colonic distention; one eventually underwent subtotal colectomy. Side effects of neostigmine included abdominal pain, excess salivation, and vomiting. Symptomatic bradycardia developed in two patients and was treated with atropine. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction who have not had a response to conservative therapy, treatment with neostigmine rapidly decompresses the colon.
10438706 | A randomized comparison of all transretinoic acid (ATRA) followed by chemotherapy and ATRA plus chemotherapy and the role of maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia. The European APL Group. | All transretinoic acid (ATRA) followed by daunorubicin (DNR)-AraC chemotherapy (CT) has improved the outcome of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by comparison to CT alone. In a randomized trial, (1) we compared 2 induction schedules (ATRA followed by CT [ATRA-->CT] and ATRA plus CT [ATRA+CT, with CT added on day 3 of ATRA treatment]) and (2) we assessed the role of maintenance treatment. Four hundred thirteen patients </=75 years of age and with newly diagnosed APL were included. Induction treatment was stratified on white blood cell (WBC) count and age: patients </=65 years of age and with an initial WBC count of </=5,000/microL (n = 208) were randomized between ATRA-->CT and ATRA+CT (initially randomized patients); patients with a WBC count greater than (high WBC count group, n = 163) and patients 66 to 75 years of age with a WBC count greater than 5,000/microL (elderly group, n = 42) were not initially randomized and received ATRA+CT from day 1 and ATRA -->CT, respectively. All patients achieving CR received 2 additional DNR-AraC courses (only 1 in patients 66 to 75 years of age) and were then randomized for maintenance between no treatment, intermittent ATRA (15 days every 3 months) for 2 years, continuous low-dose CT (6 mercaptopurine + methotrexate) for 2 years, or both, using a 2-by-2 factorial design. Overall, 381 (92%) of the patients achieved complete remission (CR), 31 (7%) suffered an early death, and only 1 patient had leukemic resistance. ATRA syndrome occurred in 64 patients (15%) and was fatal in 5 cases. The CR rate was similar in all induction treatment groups. Event-free survival (EFS) was significantly lower in the high WBC group (P =.0002) and close to significance in the elderly group (P =.086) as compared with initially randomized patients. Relapse at 2 years was estimated at 6% in the ATRA+CT group, versus 16% in the ATRA-->CT group (P =.04, relative risk [RR] =.41). EFS at 2 years was estimated at 84% in the ATRA+CT group, versus 77% in the ATRA-->CT group (P =.1, RR =.62). Two hundred eighty-nine patients were randomized for maintenance. The 2-year relapse rate was 11% in patients randomized to continuous maintenance CT and 27% in patients randomized to no CT (P =.0002) and 13% in patients randomized to intermittent ATRA and 25% in patients randomized to no ATRA (P =.02). An additive effect of continuous maintenance CT and intermittent ATRA was seen, and only 6 of the 74 patients who received both maintenance treatments had relapsed. Overall survival was improved in patients who received maintenance CT (P =.01), and there was a trend for better survival in patients who received maintenance ATRA (P =.22). Our findings strongly suggest that early addition of chemotherapy to ATRA and maintenance therapy combining continuous CT and intermittent ATRA can reduce the incidence of relapse in APL. This effect already translates into significantly better survival for maintenance treatment with continuous CT.
